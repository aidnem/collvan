COLLver ANalyzer - A suite of tools to make writing Collver programs easier

**NOTE**: The collvan project is currently on hold until the collver compiler is self-hosted.
Once the collver.collver implemention is funtional, the python implemention will be moved to this
project and reused to aid in the development of the tools. To avoid having to duplicate and update
the python implemention before it is not needed anymore in the main collver repository, collvan
is being placed temporarily on hold.

The goal of the collvan project is to provide a type-checker, and possibly some automatic code
generation tools to make collver development easier, while not having to clutter the compiler,
as the main implemention of the compiler (collver.collver) is already cluttered more than enough.
